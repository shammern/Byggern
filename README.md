TTK4155: Ping Pong Game with Distributed Embedded Control System
This repository contains the code and documentation for the TTK4155 term project, which involves designing a distributed computer-controlled electromechanical ping pong game. The project is based on assembling hardware components and developing software for microcontrollers to create a fully functional embedded system.

System Overview
The system is divided into two main parts:

Node 1: Contains a breadboard and USB multifunction board.
Node 2: Uses an Arduino Due development board with a dedicated I/O shield.
The communication between nodes is facilitated via a CAN bus, allowing for single-player or two-player game modes.
